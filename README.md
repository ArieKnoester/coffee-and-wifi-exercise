# coffee-and-wifi-exercise

# Description
Another Python course exercise using Flask, WTForms and Bootstrap-Flask. The point of the exercise was
to get more practice with these modules. As such, styles.css was provided by the course as was some 
starting code (see Initial commit). Before the Initial commit, all I had changed was moving the 
app.secret_key to an environment variable.
